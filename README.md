# Description
The FullCalendar module is compatible with all languages suppoerted by FullCalendar: https://fullcalendar.io/docs/localization.
It supports ICal formatted data from any url.
In order to actually work it downloads the ICal files and merges all calendars into one file (I haven't figured out a better solution).
