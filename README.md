# WBCE_FullCalendar
[WBCE](https://wbce.org) module for including external calendars with [fullcalendar](https://fullcalendar.io).
# Installation
1. Download latest [release](https://github.com/Atlasfreak/WBCE_FullCalendar/releases)
2. Use the WBCE module installer
# Description
The FullCalendar module supports ICal formatted data from any url and is compatible with all [languages supported by FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/localization).
In order to actually work it downloads the ICal files and merges all calendars into one file (I haven't figured out a better solution).
You are able to specify how long it will wait before trying to get a new version of the calendars.
